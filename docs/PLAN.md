# FridayGT Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a web application for a racing group that's been doing Friday racing for 15 years (Forza Motorsport) and now transitioning to Gran Turismo 7 on PlayStation.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 with Supabase adapter
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres (free tier: 500MB)
- **Email**: Resend (free tier: 3,000 emails/month)
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Lucide icons
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **State**: React Context, TanStack Query
- **Tables**: TanStack Table

## Core Requirements

1. **User Management**: Multi-user accounts with email verification, approval workflow, role-based access
2. **Lap Time Tracking**: Personal lap records per track/car, manual entry, leaderboards
3. **Car Builds & Tuning**: Save and share car setups with full GT7 upgrades and tuning settings (fills gap where GT7 lacks tune sharing)
4. **Session Management**: Create "night run lists", select combos for racing nights, assign suggested builds
5. **GT7 Integration**: Complete track database (118 tracks), complete car database (552 cars), all multiplayer lobby settings
6. **UI/UX**: GT-inspired clean design, mobile-first, simple and intuitive

## ✅ BUILD-CENTRIC ARCHITECTURE (Current - Merged to Main)

**Original Implementation**: 2026-01-17 to 2026-01-19
**Merged to Main**: 2026-01-19
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - This is now the active architecture

### Current Architecture

FridayGT uses a **build-centric** approach where:

- **Build is the primary entity and central hub**
- Every race must have builds (RaceCar.buildId is NOT NULL)
- Tracks and cars are organized by the builds that use them
- Flow: Select track → select builds (or create new) → record lap times
- Race detail page shows: all builds, leaderboard, run lists

### Key Architecture Points

1. **Database**: RaceCar.buildId is REQUIRED (NOT NULL)
2. **UI**: Race creation requires build selection
3. **Navigation**: Races and Builds are primary navigation
4. **Homepage**: Tonight page shows active races
5. **User Flow**: Create race → select builds → race night

### Features Implemented

- ✅ Build-centric race creation flow with inline build modal
- ✅ Race-specific leaderboards (only builds in race)
- ✅ Support for duplicate cars in races (multiple builds per car)
- ✅ Race configuration (laps, weather)
- ✅ Performance optimized (build pre-loading, caching, parallel requests)
- ✅ Navigation streamlined
- ✅ UX improvements (auto-close dropdowns, simplified stats)

---

## 🔗 SYSTEM INTEGRATION OVERVIEW

**Core Concept**: Everything in FridayGT revolves around **Races** (track + builds combinations). The race is the central hub that connects lap times, run lists, and builds.

**Terminology**: "Race" is used in both UI and code. Legacy "combo" terminology has been replaced.

### How Everything Connects

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        CAR + TRACK COMBO                        │

### Navigation Flow Examples

**Example 1: From Track Page to Combo**
1. User visits `/tracks/nurburgring-nordschleife`
2. Track page shows "Your Lap Times" section with all cars driven on this track
3. User clicks on "Porsche 911 GT3 RS" card
4. **Navigates to** `/combos/911-gt3-rs-992-22/nurburgring-nordschleife`
5. Combo page shows all lap times, run lists, and builds for this exact pairing

**Example 2: From Run List to Combo**
1. User visits `/run-lists/friday-night-42`
2. Run list shows 10 combos (track + car entries)
3. User clicks on "Entry 3: Spa-Francorchamps • McLaren 720S"
4. **Navigates to** `/combos/720s-20/spa-francorchamps`
5. Combo page shows this combo is used in "Friday Night #42" and 3 other run lists

**Example 3: Adding Lap Time from Session**
1. Active session: "Tonight's Run" is live at `/tonight`
2. Current combo: Brands Hatch • Porsche 911 GT3 RS
3. User clicks "Add Lap Time" button
4. Form pre-fills: track = Brands Hatch, car = 911 GT3 RS, session = Tonight's Run
5. User enters time (1:23.456), selects build (optional), adds notes
6. **On save**:
   - Lap time is linked to session, combo, and build
   - Redirects to `/combos/911-gt3-rs-992-22/brands-hatch`
   - Shows new lap time in combo history

## Race Entity Architecture (2026-01-12)

### Overview
The Race entity centralizes track + car combinations, allowing races to be reused across multiple run lists. This replaces the old combo model where track/car combinations were only stored within individual run list entries.

### Database Schema
- **Race**: Main entity with id, trackId, name, description, createdById
- **RaceCar**: Junction table linking cars/builds to a race (supports multiple cars per race)
- **RunListEntry.raceId**: Foreign key linking run list entries to races

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/races/[id]` - Fetch race with leaderboard, user stats, run lists
- `PATCH /api/races/[id]` - Update race (name, description, track, cars)
- `DELETE /api/races/[id]` - Delete race (validates not in use by run lists)

### UI Pages
- `/races/[id]` - Race detail page (read-only)
  - Displays race information, cars, builds
  - Shows statistics and leaderboard
  - Lists run lists using this race
  - Links to car/track/build pages

### Integration Points
- **Run Lists**: Can create/edit races when adding entries
- **Lap Times**: Grouped by race (user + car + build combination)
- **Leaderboards**: Calculated per race (best time per user per car per build)
- **Builds**: Displayed prominently on race pages

### Decisions Made
1. **Race page is read-only**: Editing complexity too high with auto-save and state synchronization issues
2. **Run lists handle race creation**: Run list UI is the primary way to create/edit races
3. **API remains functional**: Run lists can use PATCH endpoint to update races
4. **Simpler architecture**: Avoids complex state management issues while maintaining functionality

### Technical Details
**Attempted Features (Rolled Back)**:
- Inline editing with auto-save (debounced 1 second)
- Direct track, name, description editing
- Add/remove cars with build selector
- Delete button on each car card

**Issues Encountered**:
- Two sources of truth (race object vs raceCars state) causing desynchronization
- State corruption with undefined carId/buildId values
- Race conditions with multiple save triggers
- Delete button affecting all cars instead of one

**Resolution**:
- Reverted to simple read-only display
- Run lists continue to handle race management
- API remains functional for programmatic updates

### Files Modified
- `/src/app/races/[id]/page.tsx` - Race detail page (read-only)
- `/src/app/api/races/[id]/route.ts` - Race API endpoints
- `/src/app/run-lists/[id]/page.tsx` - Run list integration

## BUILD-CENTRIC RACE SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCE (Completed 2026-01-19)

> **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - This section documents the completed build-centric architecture for reference.

### Executive Summary

Build-centric race management system where users create races with inline build creation, multiple builds per car, and race-specific leaderboards.

### Important Decision Points

1. **Inline Build Creation**: Users can create builds in a modal without leaving race creation flow
2. **Allow Duplicate Cars**: Multiple builds from the same car can be added to one race
3. **Race-Specific Leaderboard**: Track leaderboard shows fastest laps ONLY from builds in the current race
4. **Clean Slate**: Clear ALL legacy data except user accounts, re-import cars/tracks with updated format

### User Requirements

1. **Build-Centric Flow**: Cars need builds permanently - select a car, create a build, use builds in races
2. **Race Creation**: Go to Races → Create new race → Select track → Select builds (or create new inline) → Add multiple builds → Set laps/weather
3. **Race Editing**: Open race → Edit → Add/remove builds, update laps/weather (track immutable)
4. **Race-Specific Leaderboard**: Show top 10 lap times for that track **only from builds in this race**
5. **Data Reset**: Clear all legacy data, keep only users, re-import car/track data

---

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Database Reset & Schema Changes

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20260119_complete_data_reset.sql` (NEW)

```sql
-- Migration: Complete Data Reset (Keep Users Only)
-- WARNING: This will DELETE ALL DATA except User accounts

SET session_replication_role = 'replica';

DELETE FROM "Race";
DELETE FROM "CarBuild";
DELETE FROM "LapTime";
DELETE FROM "RunList";

SET session_replication_role = 'origin';

-- Verify: Only users remain
SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining_users FROM "User";
```

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20260119_add_race_configuration.sql` (NEW)

```sql
-- Add configuration columns to Race table
ALTER TABLE "Race"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "laps" INTEGER,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "weather" VARCHAR(20);

-- Make buildId NOT NULL (clean slate)
ALTER TABLE "RaceCar"
  ALTER COLUMN "buildId" SET NOT NULL;

-- Remove unique constraint on carId (allow multiple builds from same car)
ALTER TABLE "RaceCar" DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "RaceCar_raceid_carid_key";

-- Add new constraint: One build per race
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "RaceCar_raceid_buildid_key" ON "RaceCar"("raceid", "buildid");

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "Race_laps_idx" ON "Race"("laps");
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "Race_weather_idx" ON "Race"("weather");
```

**Key Changes**:
- `RaceCar.buildId` is now NOT NULL
- Removed `RaceCar_raceid_carid_key` (allow duplicate cars)
- Added `RaceCar_raceid_buildid_key` (each build once per race)

---

#### Phase 2: API Changes

**POST /api/races** - Create Race
- Request: `{ trackId, buildIds[], name?, description?, laps?, weather? }`
- Validate: trackId required, buildIds min 1, weather in ['dry','wet']
- Create Race + RaceCar entries (one per build)
- Return complete race with builds

**PATCH /api/races/[id]** - Update Race
- Accept: `buildIds[]`, `laps`, `weather`
- **Remove**: trackId update (track is immutable)
- Delete/recreate RaceCar entries with new buildIds

**GET /api/races/[id]** - Enhanced Response
```typescript
// Race-specific leaderboard (ONLY laps from builds in this race)
const buildIds = raceCars.map(rc => rc.buildId)
const trackLeaderboard = await supabase
  .from('LapTime')
  .select(`timeMs, user, car, build`)
  .eq('trackId', trackId)
  .in('buildId', buildIds)  // FILTERED to race builds only
  .order('timeMs', { ascending: true })
  .limit(10)
```

**POST /api/builds/quick** - Quick Build Creation (NEW)
- Purpose: Inline build creation during race setup
- Request: `{ carId, name, description? }`
- Response: Created build (no upgrades/settings initially)
- Use Case: Modal in race creation page

---

#### Phase 3: UI/UX Changes

**New Race Creation Page** (`src/app/races/new/page.tsx`)

3-Step Wizard:
1. **Select Track**: Grid of all tracks with category badges
2. **Select Builds**:
   - Multi-select build list with search
   - **"Create New Build" button opens inline modal**
   - Modal: Car selector + build name + description
   - After creation: Build added to selection automatically
   - Multiple builds from same car allowed
3. **Configure**: Race name, description, laps, weather (dry/wet)

**Inline Build Modal** (`src/components/builds/QuickBuildModal.tsx` - NEW)
- Car selection dropdown (searchable)
- Build name input (required)
- Description textarea (optional)
- Create/Cancel buttons
- On success: Callback to add buildId to selectedBuilds

**Race Edit Page** (`src/app/races/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - NEW)
- Pre-populate with existing race data
- No track selection (immutable)
- Build selector with current builds selected
- Same inline build creation modal
- Config editing (laps, weather)

**Updated Race Detail Page** (`src/app/races/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Add "Edit Race" button in header
- Display race config (laps, weather) in card
- Change "Cars in this race" to "Builds in this race"
- Add **"Race Leaderboard - Top 10"** section
- Subtitle: "Fastest laps from builds in this race at {track}"

**Updated Race Listing** (`src/app/races/page.tsx`)
- Add "Create Race" button
- Display laps badge: `{race.laps} laps`
- Display weather badge with icon

**Build Selector Component** (`src/components/builds/BuildSelector.tsx` - NEW)
```typescript
interface BuildSelectorProps {
  selectedBuilds: string[]
  onBuildsChange: (buildIds: string[]) => void
  onCreateNew?: () => void
  allowDuplicateCars?: boolean
}
```
- Multi-select with search
- "Create New Build" button
- Support duplicate cars (no filtering)

---

#### Phase 4: Data Reset & Import

**Migration Steps**:
1. Backup: Export all data
2. Run Reset Migration: `20260119_complete_data_reset.sql`
3. Verify: Only User table has data
4. Re-import Cars: Use `gt7_cars_combined.csv`
5. Re-import Tracks: Use `gt7_courses_combined.csv`

**No Legacy Data Handling**: Clean slate, all build-centric from day 1

---

### Testing & Verification

**End-to-End: Create Race**
1. Navigate to /races/new
2. Select track (e.g., "Nürburgring")
3. Select 2 existing builds
4. Click "Create New Build" → Modal opens
5. Select car "Porsche 911 GT3"
6. Enter build name "Nürburgring Setup"
7. Create → Build added to selection
8. Set laps to 10, weather to "wet"
9. Create race → Redirect to detail
10. Verify 3 builds shown (same car twice OK)
11. Verify leaderboard shows "Fastest laps from builds in this race"

**Race-Specific Leaderboard**:
1. Create race at "Nürburgring" with builds A, B, C
2. Add lap times with builds A, B, C, D (D not in race)
3. View race detail → Leaderboard
4. Verify only laps from A, B, C shown
5. Add build D to race
6. Verify D's laps now appear

**Edge Cases**:
- Create race without builds → 400 error
- Invalid weather → 400 error
- Same build twice → prevented by unique constraint
- Edit race and change track → not allowed in UI
- Multiple builds from same car → should work
- Delete build referenced by race → cascade deletes RaceCar
- Race with 0 builds after edit → should allow

---

### Deployment Strategy

**Pre-Deployment**:
1. Backup database (full export)
2. Test migrations on staging
3. Test race creation flow end-to-end
4. Test leaderboard filtering

**Deployment Steps (ORDER IS CRITICAL!)**:
1. Data Reset (5 min downtime, WARNING: destructive)
2. Schema Updates (2 min downtime)
3. Re-import Data (5 min, no downtime)
4. Deploy API (zero downtime)
5. Deploy UI (zero downtime)
6. Smoke Tests

**Rollback Plan**:
- Database: Restore from backup (can't easily rollback reset)
- API/UI: Git revert + redeploy

---

### Success Metrics

**Technical**:
- Race creation <500ms
- Race detail <500ms
- 99.9% uptime
- API response <200ms

**User Adoption**:
- 70% races created with inline build modal
- 2-3 builds per race average
- 30% races have duplicate cars
- Leaderboard viewed on 90% pages
- <5% support requests
